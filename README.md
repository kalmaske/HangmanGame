# HangmanGame


around the world theme for my Hangman game!

Used key events to listen for the letters that the player choose

what the player will see on the screen

  Number of letters of the country to guess
  Player's wrong guesses 
  Number of guesses left
  Win and lose counters

After the player wins or losses a sound will play for that specific result  

The goal of this project to learn more about object-oriented programming and become more comfortable using jQuery.

Have fun playing !!
